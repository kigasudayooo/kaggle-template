## When to Use (PROACTIVE)

- Linting errors occur
- User requests code formatting
- User sets up pre-commit hooks
- User mentions "lint", "format", "品質", "type check"
- Before commits

## What This Skill Does

Ensures code quality using modern Python toolchain:
- Ruff: Linting + Formatting
- ty: Type checking
- pre-commit: Automatic checks

Refer to `tools-guide.md` for detailed configurations.
